During my masters, I particularly enjoined studying computer vision, robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and consequently I have added to my study plan all those exams pertaining to these fields. For instance, I found very interesting and educational the experience of building an autonomous mobile robot from scratch during the interdisciplinary course "Robotics and Design".

For this project we used an [Arduino Mega](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMega2560) board with several sensors to navigate the environment (optical flow sensor, magnetic compass, infrared distance sensors, color sensors) and few actuators (two motors and two servos).
