![Screenshot of Reload All Tabs](/img/screenshot.png)
Tabs are an essential part of the everyday browsing life. I always have open a browser window with a few tabs with webpages that I check several times throughout the day (e.g. Twitter, Hacker News, Techmeme, etc.). 
I have built a very simple Safari extension that adds a toolbar button to reload all the open tabs of the current window. You can download it [here](/ReloadAllTabs.safariextz)
